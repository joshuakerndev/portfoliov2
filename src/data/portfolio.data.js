        description: "This is my biggest project to date, and is the one I am most proud of. I built this site myself from scratch. It is an ongoing work in progress, built in React as a full-stack MERN application with a MongoDB database, hosted on Heroku. The github repository is currently private, as it is being developed for a client who will take it for further development into a production app at a later date, but code samples from this project are available on request. This site authenticates users and allows them to book short term rental listings. Sign up, choose a listing, book a room, and visit your profile to receive confidential address location and check in instruction information, only delivered once payment is successful. NOTE: Be careful about the website url. There is already a website with the url 'bostrent.com', which is not my work. It is a model created by somebody else for the same project. My own work can only be linked to through the above heroku url.",
